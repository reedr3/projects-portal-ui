# UI for projects portal

I designed this UI for a client. Identifying information has been removed. It provides a portal for viewing and managing their projects. It interfaces with an API, allowing them to start new projects, and kick off project tasks, all in one seamless view.


## To run locally

`git clone git@github.com:reedr3/projects-portal-ui.git`

`cd projects-portal-ui`

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

View on "http://localhost:5173/"
